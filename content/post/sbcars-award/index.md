Award received for a co-authored SBCARS paper regarding how developers can effectively find design problems when reflecting upon stinky code. The Brazilian Symposium on Software Components, Architectures, and Reuse ([**SBCARS**](http://www.lia.ufc.br/~cbsoft2017/en/xi-sbcars/chamada-de-trabalhos/)) is promoted by the Brazilian Computer Society (SBC) and attracts researchers, students, and practitioners interested in a broad range of software engineering topics, including software product lines, component-based development, architectures, and reuse.

Paper: [**Revealing design problems in stinky code: a mixed-method study**] (http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/3132498.3132514).
