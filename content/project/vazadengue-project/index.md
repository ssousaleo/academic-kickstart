Dengue is an endemic problem in many areas where public health services assistance is inefficient, and sometimes it is not even there. The Brazilian public health system cannot meet the demands of these areas due to the scarcity of resources available and the number of risk areas that requires monitoring. To make the matters worse, it is very difficult to identify and control dengue outbreaks in their initial stages. Therefore, it needs to notify focus of dengue mosquito in order to make it easier preventing dengue epidemic and to take the best actions. To assist the surveillance and detection of dengue mosquito and outbreaks, we propose an integrated platform for population to act as an etymological surveillance agent. The goal is to collect and transmit geo-referenced data, providing information to assist in entomological surveillance of dengue. To accomplish the aforementioned goal, we will developer (i) mobile applications to collect data, (ii) a web portal for centralizing data and (iii) we will mining social media to extract data and to monitor dengue outbreaks. The computational solution aims at gathering information on the reporting of the mosquito that transmits dengue. Allowing us to organize it and to plot it on maps. The point is to make it available to the government and the population.
